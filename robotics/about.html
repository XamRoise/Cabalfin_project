	<p> Technology is critical for innovation. While the worldwide are taking increasing initiative to teach robotics in schools, 
	Philippines is not doing enough to get it taught in school. Techno Camp is a company that provide an after-class activity for 
	students about robotics. The company offer three types of robotics program: Arduino, Vex IQ Robotics, and EV3 Lego Mindstorms.

<p><b>Why students should learn robotics?</b></p>
<p>
Robotics can help the students increase creativity with engineering disciplines, they can build and strengthen cognitive development such as mathematics, engineering, communication skills, strategic thinking, and goal-oriented thinking.
Robotics can build the engineering intuition through the constant engineering process, and it can emphasize meaningful problem-based learning through the integration and application of knowledge.
Robotics can engage the students in the complex, strategic problem-solving, computational thinking, and higher-order thinking in the successful research in science and engineering.
Robotics can build the ability to think through the problems strategically with a focus on logical reasoning, analytical reasoning, and the critical thinking, this ability is required not only in the critical science fields but a lot other professional area as well.
Robotics can prepare the students for the competitive workforce especially in science technology which will be in great demand and they are creative ways to keep the learning going.
